# Automatic Handwritten Answer Sheet Digitizer

This project aims to digitize handwritten academic answer sheets using Computer Vision preprocessing and LSTM-based OCR.

## Phase 1 (MTE)

- System architecture design
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV
- Baseline OCR pipeline planning

## Future Scope

- LSTM-OCR integration
- Confidence-based word filtering
- Structured digital output export
